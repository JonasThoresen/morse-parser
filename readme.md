# Morse Parsing Tool
## What is it
The tool can translate morse and text to their opposites. If text is entered, it is translated to morse and vice-versa.

## How to use
1. Launch the parser.py file with Python 3
    1. Add any arguments before launching
1. Enter morse or text
1. The opposite is displayed in the command line
1. Copy and paste this wherever needed

## Arguments
There are two arguments that can be added to change the functionality of the tool:
* -h or -help: Shows help regarding the commands below.
* -c or -clipboard: Copies data automatically to the clipboard. If this is not used, data must be copied manually once displayed in the CLI.
* -r or -retain: Retains data after quitting. If this command is not used, data is automatically purged on exit.

## Potential improvements
